# HAY GUYTH

Hello, Everyone!

  This entire project is dedicated to a little goober named Kayley, aka Kaylyeesidyeela. It started when I first saw her hawking up a chicken nugget at Chik-Fil-A because she was eating way too fast. She do love dat Chik-Fil-A. If only I could love something as much. Anywayz, when I saw her I knew I had to make a whole website dedicated to depicting the essence of her awesomeness. #Represent
  It took a full 10 months to capture enough images of her to make a suitable fan page, and I'll continue to improve upon it, at least until she discovers it and contacts the authorities.
